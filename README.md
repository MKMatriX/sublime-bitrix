just a little faster way to get to needed files


Linux keymap
[ctrl+m,ctrl+l] - components list
[ctrl+m,ctrl+k] - templates list
[ctrl+m,ctrl+s] - main style file
[ctrl+m,ctrl+j] - main js file
[ctrl+m,ctrl+h] - main header file
[ctrl+m,ctrl+f] - main footer file

cursor in includeComponent function
[ctrl+m,ctrl+c] - to component.php
[ctrl+m,ctrl+t] - to template.php

all code is REALLY dirty, and should not be used by anyone.
